Learning is done with a hybrid of both a traditional, demo-style approach and an interactive, hands-on approach. For the former, we have weekly tutorials on web development technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, and React.js. For the latter, we have project teams in which members can practice their newly-learned skills into nice, (ideally) working web applications.";
